    description: |
      Sets TX/RX pulse width, when `irda-transceiver` is enabled.

      For "auto", the pulse width will be selected when the baud rate is set to any
      speed greater than 115.2Kbps.

      This option (and its "3/16" default) is in place because SC16IS7XX's fast-speed
      modes are NOT compatible with the IrDA standard, therefore, the user must
      explicitly enable it in order to reduce conflicts.
    enum:
      - auto
      - "3/16"
      - "1/4"
