  NXP SC16IS7XX I2C/SPI to UART bridge.

  The SC16IS7XX supports both an external UART and GPIO controller. These
  controllers have to be added to the Device Tree as children of the device,
  while the SC16IS7XX device itself must be added as a child of the device
  from which it will be interfaced by (ie. either an I2C or SPI device).

  Functionality depends on the device model:

  - The SC16IS7X0 series are single-UART bridge devices.
  - The SC16IS7X2 series are dual-UART bridge devices.

  In both cases, depending on the device's configuration, up to two GPIO
  controllers can be used, from which 4 GPIO pins can be accessed from each.
  Those controllers may be associated with an UART channel, in which case the
  user can either use the controller as GPIO or as Modem Flow Control pins
  (DTR, DSR, CD and RI).

  An example I2C configuration:

    #include <zephyr/dt-bindings/mfd/nxp-sc16is7xx.h>

    &i2c0 {
      sc16is7xx: sc16is752@90 {
        compatible = "nxp,sc16is752-i2c";
        reg = < 0x90 >;

        sc16is7xx_uart0: sc16is7xx_uart_controller {
          compatible = "nxp,sc16is7xx-uart-controller";
          status = "okay";
          uart-controller;
          hw-flow-control;
          modem-flow-control;
          channel = < 0 >;
          current-speed = < 9600 >;
        };

        sc16is7xx_gpio1: sc16is7xx_gpio_controller {
          compatible = "nxp,sc16is7xx-gpio-controller";
          status = "okay";
          gpio-controller;
          channel = <1>;
          #gpio-cells = <2>;
          ngpios = <4>;
        };
      };
    };

properties:
  part-number:
    type: string
    description: |
      Indicates the part number of the device.
    enum:
      - sc16is740
      - sc16is750
      - sc16is760
      - sc16is752
      - sc16is762

  xtal-freq:
    type: int
    default: 1843200
    description:
      Frequency of the crystal associated with the device.

      Each UART channel has an individual prescaler and divider configurations
      that allow the device to generate a baud rate frequency based on the
      frequency of the crystal. Internally, the driver will try to adjust the
      prescaler to achieve the lowest possible error difference between the
      desired and actual baud rate.

      The default value is from a reference design, taken from the device's
      datasheet; but be sure to double-check if it's correct with regards to your
      hardware, otherwise UART communication may fail in unpredictable ways.

  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description:
      Indicates from which host's GPIO pin the device's hardware reset pin
      will be accessed through. If this pin is LOW, the device will be
      hardware-reset.

  interrupt-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Interrupt GPIO pin (active-low open-drain).

  'total-uart-channels':
    type: int
    description: |
      Indicates the total number of UART channels available.

  'total-gpio-channels':
    type: int
    description: |
      Indicates the total number of UART channels available.

  supports-modem-flow-control:
    type: int
    description: |
      Indicates whether this IC supports the modem control flow flags.

  shared-gpio-channels:
    type: array
    description: |
      Indicates which GPIO channels are shared with UART Modem Flow GPIOs.
      GPIO channels with the listed IDs must be configured to be either GPIO
      or Modem Flow.
