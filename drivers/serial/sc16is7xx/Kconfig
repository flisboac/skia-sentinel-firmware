    Sets the children UART controllers' initialization priorities.

    The priority MUST be higher in value (ie. lower in priority) than
    MFD_SC16IS7XX_DEVICE_INIT_PRIORITY.

    If GPIO is also used, it's advised for UART's priority to be HIGHER
    (ie. lower in value) than GPIO_SC16IS7XX_INIT_PRIORITY, as the UART
    is generally the main use case for this chip, and therefore, should
    also be taken as a priority if GPIO ports collide with modem flow
    control ports.
